### Problem Solving

Identify the problem:
- Who is the individual?
- What is the problem?
- How long do you have to address it?

Generate a problem statement: recognize the appropriate problem. Allows you to test and evaluate later.

Gathering Data
- Facts: Observed truths about the situation
- Criteria: Boundaries
- Definitions: Explain unfamiliar terms
- Assumptions - Statements that may or may not be true

Barriers
- Habit- "No need to change, I like doing it this way"
- Fear - "Scared to bring up new ideas or raise it to a higher authority?"
- Inertia - "Lack of desire to expend the energy to change."
- Prejudice - "Preference for one's own ideas or dislike for others."
