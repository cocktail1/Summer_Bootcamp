JMP reads all data into RAM, so it is limited in the amount of data it can load, unlike SAS.

There's the **Home** window, with 4 components: recent files, windows list w/reports, recent help, jmp project window (not used much).

Saving JMP scripts to the data table is a good way to create an audit trail for work reproducability.

You must use double-quotes in JMP if you want to create or interrogate text values.

If you need to send JMP data to somebody who doesn't have it, create a journal in JMP and then Save As to a format that you can save with them.

Hold control when you select a command from the red triange to "broadcast" that command to all similar graphs.

Correlations:
Analyze -> Multivariate -> Multivariate
Look under the red triangle for Multivariate and look for Pairwise correlations
Right-click on the table and create data table
